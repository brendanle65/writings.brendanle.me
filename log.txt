    1. ?

notes:
    1. During dev their may be a flash of the browser's default font family as it's being fetched.
       At build time, the fonts will be bundeled. So, this issue will resolve itself.
    2. See `public/scripts/theme.js` for details on why we choose the particular business logic that we did
       to set the theme.
    3. During dev you may see the theme being transitioned when the page is first loaded, instead of 
       set correctly initially. At build time, this behavior resolves on its own.

commit: 
    1. fixed bug where incorrect theme was being set when toggled
    2. fixed bug where cursor styles were not being set
    3. changed theme state from being stored in session storage to local storage for persistence across sessions
    4. Added more sections to `log.txt`
