todo:
    1. add blog page layout
    2. get rid of polaroid image - kinda of tacky, just use plain image instead
    3. add real content (dummy data to local data)
    4. fix excerpt scramble component
    5. rewrite home image component to be more pure (no refs inside animation functions)

ideas:
    1. featured highlights for some writings, similar to annotations
    2. change highlight animation to resemble more of an actual highlighter

notes:
    1. During dev their may be a flash of the browser's default font family as it's being fetched.
       At build time, the fonts will be bundeled. So, this issue will resolve itself.
    2. See `public/scripts/theme.js` for details on why we choose the particular business logic that we did
       to set the theme.
    3. During dev you may see the theme being flickered. At build time, this behavior resolves on its own.
    4. The AppLayout component is included on each page rather than being centrally located in `pages/_app.ts`.
       This is to ensure that the page animation scope (ref) is set individually at the page level,
       instead of managing it globally through state higher up in the component tree.
