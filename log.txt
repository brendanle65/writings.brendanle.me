todo:
    1. Add header and footer
    2. Add layout of writing page

ideas:
    1. ?

notes:
    1. During dev their may be a flash of the browser's default font family as it's being fetched.
       At build time, the fonts will be bundeled. So, this issue will resolve itself.
    2. See `public/scripts/theme.js` for details on why we choose the particular business logic that we did
       to set the theme.
    3. During dev you may see the theme being flickered. At build time, this behavior resolves on its own.

commit:
