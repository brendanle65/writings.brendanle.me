      <div data-type="line">I’m a poet and a dreamer.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">All I wish for once in my life is</div>
      <div data-type="line">for a woman to lock eyes with me</div>
      <div data-type="line">and have her world set on fire.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">To see her frantically divert her gaze.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see her throat tighten.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see the panic register on her face</div>
      <div data-type="line">    as she realizes that she is indeed beginning to blush</div>
      <div data-type="line">        and how any attempts to manage it,</div>
      <div data-type="line">            only makes the blood throb harder.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see her chest rising and falling</div>
      <div data-type="line">    not like hills but like mountains.</div>
      <div data-type="line">And after what feels like days,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    when she has finally conquered herself,</div>
      <div data-type="line">        for me to lightly tap her on the shoulder</div>
      <div data-type="line">and have her world set on fire.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      
      <div data-type="line">To see her turn around and be tongue-tied.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see how she hangs on to my every word,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    as she stumbles over hers.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see her become self-conscious, scrambling to regain favor—</div>
      <div data-type="line">    laughing at things I said that aren’t funny,</div>
      <div data-type="line">        playing with her hair.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see it dawn on her that she has overcorrected,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    and now do an awful job of pretending:</div>
      <div data-type="line">        she can cross her arms;</div>
      <div data-type="line">        she can lower her pitch;</div>
      <div data-type="line">        she can even say the words fine;</div>
      <div data-type="line">            but, her face betrays her.</div>
      <div data-type="line">And when the conversation is winding down,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    when she thinks she has made a total fool of herself,</div>
      <div data-type="line">        that all is lost,</div>
      <div data-type="line">            for me to ask for her number,</div>
      <div data-type="line">and have her world set on fire.</div>

      <div data-type="line"> </div>
      <div data-type="dinkus" />
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">To see her skip in between the parked cars.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see her red dress pirouetting under the street lights.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see her flush when I suddenly</div>
      <div data-type="line">    kiss her.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see her teasingly annoyed when I pull back</div>
      <div data-type="line">    before she can kiss me back.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see that two can play at that game,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    tripping me on purpose, saying,</div>
      <div data-type="line">        “sorry,” <em>but not sorry.</em></div>
      <div data-type="line">And when there is a lull in the playful antics,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    when there is time for both of us to reflect</div>
      <div data-type="line">        on what the night is starting to become,</div>
      <div data-type="line">            for me to caress her sweet rosy cheeks</div>
      <div data-type="line">and have her world set on fire.</div>

      <div data-type="line"> </div>
      <div data-type="dinkus" />
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">To feel her caressing my veins with her fingers.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see a love bite grow as I taste her neck.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To feel the heat radiating through our clothes,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    soaking each other completely wet.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To hear the fabric strain as I rip off her top.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To smell our odors mixing into a love potion,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    as I watch a drop of sweat fall from her cheek</div>
      <div data-type="line">        down to the valley between her breasts,</div>
      <div data-type="line">            tracing a small stream there.</div>
      <div data-type="line">And when I go to unhook her bra</div>
      <div data-type="line">    to play with the tips of her mountains—</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">She gulps. She sighs. She moves her body away.</div>
      <div data-type="line">Shame and trauma fills her eyes.</div>
      <div data-type="line">Sex is no longer sex; it is an opening of old wounds.</div>
      <div data-type="line">She’s sobbing.</div>
      <div data-type="line">She’s sorry.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">I tell her there is no need to be.</div>
      <div data-type="line"><em>I understand. We can stop.</em> There are other ways to love.</div>
      <div data-type="line">I hold her in my arms and kiss her forehead.</div>
      <div data-type="line">I am most tender despite all the rage I hold</div>
      <div data-type="line">against the preparator, against the world.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">After a while, her sobbing stops.</div>
      <div data-type="line">She says she wants to continue.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>


      <div data-type="line">And so we did.</div>
      <div data-type="line">I told her that I will go slow and that anytime she saw the monster,</div>
      <div data-type="line">we would stop.</div>
      <div data-type="line">                            But we did not stop.</div>

      <div data-type="line"> </div>
      <div data-type="dinkus" />
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">I wish that whoever <em>She</em> is,</div>
      <div data-type="line">would choose me not only in this lifetime,</div>
      <div data-type="line">but in every lifetime.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>
      
      <div data-type="line">That to choose anybody else</div>
      <div data-type="line">would be like traveling to Las Vegas to see the Eiffel Tower</div>
      <div data-type="line">when you live in Paris.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">God, if you are listening,</div>
      <div data-type="line">I wish</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">To see her walk down the aisle.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To see our babies be born.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To hear her lecture our children—and me, sometimes.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To taste the love in her cooking.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To feel her wrinkles come in.</div>
      <div data-type="line">To smell her even when my nose stops working.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">And after all that,</div>
      <div data-type="line">    when it is my time to go,</div>
      <div data-type="line">        when my casket is being lowered,</div> 
      <div data-type="line">            for her to remember all our memories together:</div>
      <div data-type="line">                the first time she met me,</div>
      <div data-type="line">                our first kiss,</div>
      <div data-type="line">                how angry I got when she brought home a cat,</div>
      <div data-type="line">                how drunk and funny her cousin was at our wedding,</div>
      <div data-type="line">                how I fell off a ladder when we were painting the house</div>
      <div data-type="line">                …</div>
      <div data-type="line">            —the sound of shoveling begins,</div>
      <div data-type="line">and have her world set on fire.</div>

      <div data-type="line"> </div>
      <div data-type="dinkus" />
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">I’m a poet and a dreamer.</div>
      <div data-type="line"> </div>

      <div data-type="line">All I wish for once in my life is</div>
